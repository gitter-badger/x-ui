# view.DO Experience UI Framework


view.DO's Experience UI is the first tool-set built specifically for rich, low-code, interactive web experiences. 

This set of inter-working web-components extend HTML, allowing for the declarative expression for web-developers to create engaging experiences with guided navigation, timed-audio, timed/sequenced-video, hooks for animations and much more.

These components use a convention-over-configuration approach to guide user behavior with your content in a rule-based, presentation format.
