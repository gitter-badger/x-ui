# X-AUDIO-LOAD-SOUND

This component declares audio used within this **`<x-view-do>`** route. The **`<x-audio-sound-load>`** represents audio files and play behaviors. They are all sent to the global-audio player to pre-load or play when the route is active. The player manages them according to their settings.  

## Usage

````html
<x-view-do>
  <x-audio-sound-load
    mode="queue|play|load"
    track-id="<unique-id>"
    src="<url>"    
    discard="route|next|none"
    track>
    </x-audio-sound-load>    
</x-view-do>
````

### Simple

````html
<x-view-do>
  <x-audio-sound-load   
    track-id="<unique-id>"
    src="<url>"></x-audio-sound-load>    
</x-view-do>
````

## Timed

For timed audio, the audio is sent up front for pre-loading. Then at the given time, a separate **`<x-audio-action>`** event is dispatched to play it at a given time. This way, the audio is likely to play on time without any buffering. 


The following demonstrates how to load a track, and wait 10 seconds until it plays. It's important to remember this time can be paused by the user, so it's could be any amount of time if a video is playing.

````html
<x-view-do>
  <x-audio-sound-load 
    track-id="audio1"
    src="<url>">
  </x-audio-sound-load>
  <x-action-activator
    activate="AtTime"
    time="10">
    <x-audio-action
      type="sound"
      command="start"
      track-id="audio1">
    </x-audio-action>
  </x-action-activator>
</x-view-do>
````

#### Mode:
- **queue**: (default) plays after the previous audio is complete or when it's requested.
- **play**: stop any playing audio and play now, buffering be-damned.
- **wait**: wait for an event action before playing, any currently playing audio continues.

#### Discard:
- video: when any video plays (default for sound)
- state: state changes
- event: wait for a stop event (or any other activation)
- none: loop until stopped or updated by new state (default for music)

#### Track:

If audio has replay set to true, re-entry to the originating state will re-activate the audio if the previous audio has been deactivated. The default is false.
