# X-AUDIO-LOAD-MUSIC

This component declares audio used within this **`<x-view-do>`** route. The **`<x-audio-music-load>`** represents audio files and play behaviors. They are all sent to the global-audio player to pre-load or play when the route is active. The player manages them according to their settings. 

## Usage

````html
<x-view-do>
  <x-audio-music-load
    mode="play|load" 
    track-id="<unique-id>"
    src="<url>"    
    discard="route|video|next|none"
    loop
    track
    ></x-audio-music-load>
    
</x-view-do>
````

### Simple

````html
<x-view-do>
  <x-audio-music-load    
    track-id="<unique-id>"
    src="<url>"></x-audio-music-load>
    
</x-view-do>

````html
<x-view-do>
  <x-audio
    load="queue"
    id="<unique-id>"
    src="<url>"    
    discard="none"
    loop></x-audio>
    
</x-view-do>

#### Mode:
- **queue**: (default) plays after the previous audio is complete or when it's requested.
- **play**: stop any playing audio and play now, buffering be-damned.
- **wait**: wait for an event action before playing, any currently playing audio continues.

#### Discard:
- video: when any video plays (default for sound)
- state: state changes
- event: wait for a stop event (or any other activation)
- none: loop until stopped or updated by new state (default for music)

#### Track:

If audio has replay set to true, re-entry to the originating state will re-activate the audio if the previous audio has been deactivated. The default is false.
