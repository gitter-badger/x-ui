# Interface Provider

> The Interface Provider System is a way to make UX actions occur without scripting.

The Interface Provider listens for actions sent through the action-bus and performs those commands.

## Built-in Provider
The built-in providers provides basic functionality by handling the following commands:




## Custom Interface Provider
You can extend this system by adding your own provider, using a Register Interface Provider Event Action.

The system listens for custom events in the action topic: **interface**

To register a provider, provide a unique name and an instance that implements IDataProvider and that data will become available within the expression system.

**Custom Event to Register a Provider:**

````typescript
new CustomEvent('actionEvent', {
  detail: {
    topic: 'interface'
    command: "register-provider",
    data: {
      name: 'myprovider',
      provider: providerInstance
    }
  }
})
````

**Interface Provider Interface:**

````typescript
type InterfaceProvider = {
  alert(message: string): Promise<void>;
  openToast(args: any): Promise<void>;
  modalOpen(args: any): Promise<void>;
  modalClose(args: any): Promise<void>;
  openPopover(args: any): Promise<void>;
  setTheme(theme: 'dark'| 'light'): void;
  setAutoPlay(autoPlay: boolean): void;
  setSound(muted: boolean): void;
  onChange: EventEmitter
};
````

### Interface State

````typescript
class InterfaceState {
  theme: 'light' | 'dark' | string;
  muted: boolean;
  autoplay: boolean;
}
````

### On Changed Event
To notify the system that the underlying ui-data has changed, the interface includes a simple event emitter with the name of the property that changed: theme, muted, or autoplay 


### Sample Registrations

### Default Interface Provider

````typescript


````

#### Native JS 
All that is needed by the data-system is a custom event with an instance of your provider in the details.data.provider property. *Note: be sure the event is composed, so it can reach shadow-dom listeners.*

````javascript

const customProvider = new MyProvider(); // IDataProvider
const event = new CustomEvent('actionEvent', { 
  detail: { 
    topic: 'interface',
    command: 'register-provider'
    data: {
      name: 'myprovder,
      provider: customProvider,
    },
  }
});

document.body.dispatchEvent(event, { bubbles: true, composed: true})

````


#### As Component [StencilJS]

````typescript
import { Component, Event, EventEmitter, Prop, State, h } from '@stencil/core';

@Component({
  tag: 'my-interface-provider',
  shadow: false,
})
export class MyInterfaceProvider {
  private customProvider = new MyProvider();

  /**
   * This event is raised when the component loads.
   * The data-provider system should capture this event
   * and register the provider for use in expressions.
   */
  @Event({
    eventName: 'actionEvent',
    bubbles: true,
    composed: true,
  }) actionEvent: EventEmitter<any>;

  @State() keys = [];

  componentDidLoad() {
    this.raiseAction.emit({
      topic: 'interface',
      command: 'register-provider',
      data: {
        name: this.name,
        provider: this.customProvider,
      },
    });
  }
}
````

Then just include your component somewhere on the page:

````html
<x-ui>
  ...
 <my-interface-provider></my-interface-provider>
````
