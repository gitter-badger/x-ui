## Static Routing

Static routing uses HTML to declare path wrappers around content HTML, to hide and display content based on the page content path.

<x-link href="/navigation/static"
  custom="button" anchor-class="btn btn-info text-white">
  <i class="ri-treasure-map-line"></i>
  Static Routing
</x-link>

## Guided Navigation

Guided navigation is for presentation-based content. This creates a back/next format with a convention-based next route automatically determined by the router. 
  
<x-link href="/navigation/guided"
  custom="button" anchor-class="btn btn-info text-white" >
  <i class="ri-gps-line"></i>
