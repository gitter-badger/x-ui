# X-INCLUDE

This component fetches remote HTML as defined in the src attribute and renders it to the page.

````html
<x-include src="<url-to-html>">
</x-include>
````

### Delayed Rendering

When using this component, you may want to delay the fetch until the content is needed. The **no-render** attribute will prevent the HTML from being fetched until that attribute is removed.

````html
<x-include id="include" src="<url-to-html>" no-render>
</x-include>
````

You can remove the attribute programmatically to force the fetch:

````javascript
const include = document.querySelector("#include);
include.removeAttribute('no-render');
````

Or, just include it in one of the components **\<x-view\>** or  **\<x-view-do\>**. These components remove any 'no-render' attributes on child elements once their route is activated, giving us lazy-loaded routes with this component.
